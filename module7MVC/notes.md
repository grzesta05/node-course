## MVC Description

**MVC** - Model View Controler is an architectural pattern that separates projects into three parts:

- **Models** - are responsible for data representation and management
- **Views** are basically what user sees, it is decoupled from application code
- **Controllers** - are used to connect **Models** with **Views**. it contains "in between" logic
